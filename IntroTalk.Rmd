- Infinite amounts of time
- Rescue poorly designed experiments

## What is Bioinformatics?

> __Bioinformatics__ *is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data.* 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics)<br>

Combines _computer science_, _statistics_ and _mathematics_ to analyse and interpret biological data.


## What is Bioinformatics?

- Is Bioinformatics inherently reductionist as in common genomics, proteomics etc. technologies?
- Or is it building networks & systems biology?
- Is medical imaging analysis bioinformatics?
- Is proteomics part of bioinformatics?
- What about statistical analysis of RT-PCR?
- Is it population genetics or molecular genetics?

## What is Bioinformatics?

- An almost endlessly broad field
- Biology is becoming more and more computer driven
- Need at least two of the following skills:
    - Familiarity with biological systems
    - Statistical knowledge
    - Applied Mathematical knowledge
    - Coding/Programming Skills
    - Understanding of data/computing

## What is Bioinformatics?

__pre-2007__

- Strong statistical focus
- Keep all the data we possibly can

__post-2007__

- -omics Data "Explosion"
- Data handling became the key issue
- Non-NGS approaches have faded significantly

## A Key Problem

__Within 10 years__

Data:       | Astronomy     | You Tube  | Genomics 
----------- | ------------- | --------- | --------
Acquisition | 25,000 EB /yr | 2 EB / yr | 250 EB /yr
Storage     | 1 EB / yr     | 2 EB /yr  | 2-40 EB /yr
Analysis    | Real-time     | Minimal   | >10,000 trillion<br>(1016) CPU hours

<br>
$1$ EB $\approx 10^9$ GB

(Stephens et al)

## What This Means For Us

- Bioinformatics needs massive streamlining of data processing
- Trivial Solutions (e.g. Excel, Prism) are not applicable
- Need Coding Skills
- GUI based approaches limit your skills development

## Reproducible Research

- Has two meanings

1. Results can be replicated biologically
2. Results can be replicated computationally
